    Whether you partied all night, stayed up with a newborn, or lost sleep while finishing up a project, now you&#8217;re at <a title="Look for Work" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Look-for-Work">work</a> and you&#8217;re having a difficult time staying awake. You promise yourself that you&#8217;ll get more sleep, if you can just make it through the day without being discovered by your boss with your eyes closed. Here&#8217;s how to have a good sleep. If you want to go to sleep at 8.30.

        <strong>Use your <a title="Describe a Smell" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Describe-a-Smell">sense of smell</a></strong>. A strong scent, good or bad, can make you more alert very quickly. Aromatherapists often recommend essential oils of the following plants to stimulate the nervous system and reduce fatigue (open the bottle and take a big whiff when you&#8217;re feeling drowsy):<sup id="_ref-0"><a title="" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Stay-Awake-at-Work#_note-0">[1]</a></sup>

                      Of course, not all of us have essential oils stored in our file cabinets, but using hand lotions or burning candles with these same scents could help. Herbs like rosemary and peppermint can often be found fresh or dried at a grocery store; for a little pick-me-up, take a pinch and roll it between your fingertips and smell it.

                            <strong><strong>Expose yourself to bright light</strong>, preferably natural daylight</strong>. Your body&#8217;s internal clock, its circadian rhythms, are regulated by your exposure to sufficient light. Even if you&#8217;re in an environment where there&#8217;s artificial light, brighter is better. If you can step outside (even on a cloudy day) or look out the window for a full minute, you&#8217;ll be more alert. Wherever you work, see if you can replace the light fixture or add a lamp that will brighten your workspace.

                                Stay on your feet as much as possible. If you have to sit down, get the most uncomfortable chair you can find. Try not to sit in anything that will make you sore if you stay there. Make sure the back is upright, forcing you to sit up very straight. Don&#8217;t allow your head to rest on anything&#8211;your hands, the desk, the wall. <div>

                            <strong>Avoid a full stomach</strong>. Munch on snacks all day, rather than having a big meal. The key is to not get a spike of sugar intake (followed by the inevitable crash). The same goes for caffeine. Break your consumption down into small doses. <ul>

When your mind starts to go blank, think about something, be it a joke, a movie, anything to keep your mind working. Even thinking about something that makes you mad can be extremely helpful. Unless they&#8217;re drinking, you typically don&#8217;t see an angry person abruptly fall asleep.

                              <strong>*When listening to music to stay awake it&#8217;s a common misconception that blasting it loud will keep you awake</strong>. Actually turning the music to a very low level actually is more effective. It forces you to try to listen to it to hear the instruments, lyrics, etc. If you&#8217;re having difficulty discerning the lyrics, then you&#8217;re already doing it right, because this means your mind&#8217;s working.

                              <strong>*Have a regular bedtime and a healthy diet</strong>. Brains benefit greatly from schedules. If you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even the weekends, your brain know when it&#8217;s time to sleep and fall into a pattern. Getting proper nutrition will also ensure that your body has the proper energy throughout the day without having to resort to naps for extra strength.</li> </ol> </div>
